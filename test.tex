    \section{Introduction}

    Hello, this is the first attempt at creating a \textbf{tex} file using Microsoft VSCode
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is really cool!
        \item I feel like I've learned so much this past day
    \end{itemize}
    This was added on my secondary laptop
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item so cool!
        \item second item ..
    \end{enumerate}

    This is some text!
    This is a new line in my editor!
    Some more text that I am hoping will wrap around to display the odd behavior of latex returns

    You have to make two returns!

    \section{Numbering}

    \section{Formatting}

    This is normal text.
    \textbf{This is bold text!}
    \textit{This is italic.}

    \emph{This is emphatic.}

    \underline{Here is some underlined text.}

    \subsection{subsection}

    "This is in quotation marks."

    ``This is in proper quotation marks.''

    'This is in proper quotation marks.'
